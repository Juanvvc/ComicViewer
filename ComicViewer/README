A simple comic viewer for Android. It has a gallery activity to show
the cover of the available comics, bookmarking support and shows
comic in CBR, CBZ and directories of JPG/PNG images. This is a test
project to use in education, by no means is intended for final users
but should be highly usable and stable.

Source code is fully commented. You can download the last version
